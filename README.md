# Translator App

This is a Python-based Translator App that allows users to translate text between multiple languages and also hear the translated text spoken aloud. Built entirely in Python, the app leverages language translation and text-to-speech features, making it a useful tool for both language learners and everyday communication.

## Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Translate text between any two languages of your choice.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Hear the translated text spoken aloud using a built-in speech engine.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy interaction.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `googletrans==4.0.0-rc1` (for language translation)
- `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech library)
- `playsound` (to play the speech output)
- `tkinter` (for building the app's GUI)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1 gtts playsound tkinter
